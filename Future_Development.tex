\section{Future Development}

	Once the current areas of FPGA development discussed in this document are complete, focus can be directed on areas of the LLI still in active developemt.
	One such area is in the processing of incoming data from the optical links into frames in the DAQ, currently being worked on by a colleague in Manchester University.
	However, due to the nature of the development being spead over many European countries, reliably predicting the next step in development is a not possible.
	\par
	Once the FPGA development is complete and the VELO upgrade is implemented in 2019, the more accurate VELO data will allow for greater statistical analysis and more significant results.
	This is of particular interest for rare processes, such as CP violation, which are largely dominated by statistical error with the current LCHb data.
