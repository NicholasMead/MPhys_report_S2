\section{Future Development}

	With the EIF module designed and ready for testing, the next stage of development is to integrate the EIF into the master code for the FPGA.
	From here, tools such as Quartus are able to design the signal routes within the FPGA.
	It is still unclear if this will be possible, however the only way to find out it to implement the EIF into the full FPGA code, compile and then test on the chip itself.

	Limitations may be due to resources or routing of signals.
	One can hope, but never make any real deductions as to the feasibility of the project.

	One of the reasons that information on EIF implementation is vague is because the FPGA currently planned to be used is not yet on the market.
	Therefore many of the necessary test are not possible at this point in time.
	Engineering prototypes are available, however the architecture of these chips are likely to differ from the production model.
	As unsatisfactory as one may find this result, the destiny of the project from here is still to be decided and such as decision not possible at this time.
