	This document discusses two areas of FPGA development for the LHCb VELO upgrade scheduled to coincide with LHC Long Shutdown 2 in 2019.
	The areas of development are the selection of a suitable scrambling algorithum and the continued work on the event isolation flagging.
	\\ \\
	The analaysis for three scrambling algorithms, required for data transfer from the front end elctronics to the Data Aquisition FPGA, was compared against the theoretical predictions of scrambled data.
	It was found that the currently implemented VeloPix scrambler is the optimum of the choices but also that an alternative multiplicative scrambler was suitable for computer simulations.
	\\ \\
	Event Isolations Flaging (EIF) system is intended to identify and flag the easier to re-construct events in order to reduce event pile-up in the computer network.
	Despite a bug being identified in the simulated data, the VHDL development is ongoing.
	A bubble sorting algorithum, implemented by the EIF system, is ready for testing.
	Once the EIF system is complete, it will be implemented in the master code for the low level interface.
