	This document discusses two areas of FPGA development for the LHCb VELO upgrade scheduled to coincide with LHC Long Shutdown 2 in 2019.
	The areas of development are the selection of a suitable scrambling algorithm and the continued work on the event isolation flagging.
	\\ \\
	The analysis for three scrambling algorithms, required for data transfer from the front end electronics to the Data Acquisition FPGA, was compared against the theoretical predictions of scrambled data.
	It was found that the currently implemented VeloPix scrambler is the optimum of the choices but also that an alternative multiplicative scrambler was suitable for computer simulations.
	\\ \\
	Event Isolations Flagging (EIF) system is intended to identify and flag the easier to re-construct events in order to reduce event pile-up in the computer network.
	The module is complete as a stand-alone project and ready for implementation into the master FPGA code.
	Only once the implementation is complete will the routing and resources be tested.
	Assuming testing is successful, the EIF module will be complete.
