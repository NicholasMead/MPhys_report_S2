** DONE Equations, with or without punctuation?
definatly punctuated, always.
** DONE Data of draft confurmation?
be the weekend, this week.
** DONE Can I write the scramlber section with a 'convient' time scale, i.e. velopix scrambler is the proposed replactment for additive but we are also concidering an alternative?

just state the current situation, not at historical account.
** DONE Does the title, contence and bibliography count in the page count?
not a scrict limit but good reason for writing more\ less. give good account of project.
make sure everything is needed, dont be bulkly, use apendics if needed.
** DONE Line numbers?
DEFINATLY NOT FOR FINAL - but yes for drafts
** DONE software referances
looks for manual or how the companies want to be cited.
